 <h1> Background </h1>
Orangutan has been endangered and their population has been dwindling in recent years.
EIAâ€™s findings are alarming in light of a 2018 study that found the island of Borneo alone lost an estimated 148,500 orangutans between 1999 to 2015

Moreover, a natural or artificial disaster such as forest fires may threaten their safety, and rescue by SAR Team would be needed.
